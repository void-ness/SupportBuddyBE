  "highlights": "coffee. Mera zukhaam. Rajma chawal. Jo maine system pharda hai.",
  "challenges": "Meri tabiyat. Went very wrong. Hoping i get well soon. Scared for tomorrow. Lets see",
  "reflection": "subah oncall dekhi. Fir daddy ki tabiyat thordi down si thi. Cheer up kra unhe. Published post pe views kam the to use reschedule mar diya. Dosto ke sath ghumne gya. Had fun. Pehle soch rha tha na jaun. Bimar hogya bas bhot jyada. Raat ko aake to phat gyi. office mai mere work mai ek issue aagya. Dar lag rha",
  "gratitude": "Again, having the liberty to go out, eat stuff i want. Broke stuff, still team member was not very angry about it. Calmly released the fix. Kal hoga jo hona hai ab to. Hoping kuch major na ho. Aur mera zukhaam thik ho jae yaar"

Health is wealth. Take care of your health. Everything else can take a backseat. There's nothing to be scared about. Mistakes happenps. What matters is what we learn from them. Tune kuch intentionally galat thordi kra hai? Just be honest. No need to over think. what will happen will happen in due course of time. maybe go to work and spread your flu them unwell as well lol. it's all about learning and making sure to not make the same mistake again. galti sirf ek baar hoti hai. baar bar to bas .... iykyk. as you rightly mentioned, what matters is how you and your team dealt with it. your team member calmly fixing shows a lot of maturity. eating your favorite food is a cherry on top in such situations. take care of your cold. have ample of rest. 

Days like these teach us the importance of being consistent. Keep writing such stuff down to offload some weight from your heart. I am more than happy to read through them.
next time, tell me more about what your favorite food is apart from rajma chawal xD!

The plumber took 300? Looks like some pipes were choked very hard. I was in favour of you until I read about you eating chole bhature. Some lassi must have really made it down the pipe haha. Bhar na jaana thorda frustating to hoskta hai, but think of it as break to rest and recharge. You did so many things today and still think that you had a bummer of a day? Who are you competing with? Elon Musk? take a chill pill my friend. I feel so happy reading about all the tasty food that you had throughout the day. Keep cherishing eating delicious food like this. You have all the reasons to be thankful to the almighty. The god also showers love for kind souls like you. Hoping these wishes add up to your launch tomorrow.

With your upcoming launch and a new look on your face, we have all the reasons to keep talking, don't we? haha! All the best champ. Rooting for your success!
